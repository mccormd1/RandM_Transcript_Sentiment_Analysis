Only well known, named characters are titled, subtitles from lesser known characters have no header, which may be an issue. Remaining Season 2 (and season 3 transcripts) have some extra annoyances. The subtitles available do not list which characters are saying which lines, and it is in ALL CAPS. Second thing isn't that bad but first needs manual correction."
