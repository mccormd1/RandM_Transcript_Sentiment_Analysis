    "### Data Quality Dimensions:\n",
    "Data quality dimensions help guide your thought process while assessing and also cleaning. The four main data quality dimensions are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Completeness: do we have all of the records that we should? Do we have missing records or not? Are there specific rows, columns, or cells missing?\n",
    " - Validity: we have the records, but they're not valid, i.e., they don't conform to a defined schema. A schema is a defined set of rules for data. These rules can be real-world constraints (e.g. negative height is impossible) and table-specific constraints (e.g. unique key constraints in tables).\n",
    " - Accuracy: inaccurate data is wrong data that is valid. It adheres to the defined schema, but it is still incorrect. Example: a patient's weight that is 5 lbs too heavy because the scale was faulty.\n",
    " - Consistency: inconsistent data is both valid and accurate, but there are multiple correct ways of referring to the same thing. Consistency, i.e., a standard format, in columns that represent the same data across tables and/or within tables is desired."
