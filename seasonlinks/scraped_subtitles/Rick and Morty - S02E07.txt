WHAT'S NEW AT SCHOOL?
-NOTHING,
NOTHING! OH, UH, ONE
OF THE LUNCH LADIES DIED,
THEY FOUND HER IN THE GYM WITH,
LIKE, TWO HOLES IN HER NECK
AND ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED
OUT OF HER,
GOOD LORD! WHO DOES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE,
W-W-WHERE'S THE PEPPER?
WAIT, WHAT?!
VAMPIRES ARE REAL?!
YES, SUMMER, VAMPIRES
ARE REAL, WHO KNEW?
OH, RIGHT, ALL HUMANITY,
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, NOW,
YEAH, SUMMER,
IT'S A BIG UNIVERSE,
GET USED TO IT,
R-RIGHT, RICK?
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?!
WE'RE GONNA LIVE OUR LIVES
UNTIL WE DIE,
POSSIBLY BY VAMPIRE,
MORE LIKELY AUTO ACCIDENT
OR HEART DISEASE,
BUT POSSIBLY VAMPIRE,
GRANDPA RICK, COULDN'T YOU,
LIKE, USE YOUR SUPERKNOWLEDGE
TO TURN YOURSELF INTO A TEENAGER
AND COME TO OUR SCHOOL
AND HELP US HUNT
THE VAMPIRE DOWN?
UM -- WOW,
YEAH, PRETTY SPECIFIC
PITCH, SUMMER,
I PROBABLY <i>COULD</i>
TURN MYSELF INTO A TEENAGER
AND HANG OUT IN THE
ZIT-COVERED, HORMONE-ADDLED,
LOW-STAKES ASSWORLD
THAT IS HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT HERE'S MY REVERSE-ASK --
WHY IN THE [BLEEP]
WOULD I EVER DO THAT, EVER?
AND HOW DARE YOU
EVEN ASK ME THAT?
AND WHY AREN'T YOU MORE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?
DAD!
BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF,
SWEETIE,
JERRY! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
JUST SAID TO OUR DAUGHTER?
SOR-RY! I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION,
TO A CONVERSATION
ABOUT VAMPIRES?!
CLEARLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ABOUT VAMPIRES,
BECAUSE I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION,
WHICH <i>YOU</i> WOULD KNOW,
IF <i>YOU</i> EVER
PAID ATTENTION TO <i>ME!</i>
OH, HERE WE GO,
RIGHT TO THE VICTIM ROLE,
AM I A VICTIM, BETH,
OR AM I MARRIED
TO A MEAN, UNFAIR MONSTER
THAT ALWAYS HURTS ME?!
JESUS CHRIST!
WILL YOU FIX YOUR MARRIAGE
OR GET A DIVORCE ALREADY?
WELL, WE TRIED
A COUPLES' THERAPIST,
THAT'S EARTH THERAPY,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK A HORSE
TO FIX A MERRY-GO-ROUND,
I MEAN, HE'LL TRY HIS BEST,
BUT MOSTLY,
HE'S JUST GONNA GET HORRIFIED,
I KNOW ABOUT A PLACE OFF-PLANET
WITH A 100% SUCCESS RATE,
WELL, WE WANT TO MAKE IT
WORK, IF WE CAN,
IT'S JUST --
-THEN IT'S SETTLED,
NO NEED TO PACK,
-OH!
LET'S GO, GO, GO, GO!
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
DO YOU THINK MOM AND DAD
ARE, YOU KNOW,
GONNA GET A DIVORCE?
I THINK IT'S OKAY
TO DREAM, MORTY,
I'M GONNA GO MAKE
SOME WOODEN STAKES,
I BOOKED YOU FOR A TWO-DAY
INTENSIVE AT NUPTIA FOUR,
THE GALAXY'S MOST SUCCESSFUL
COUPLES' COUNSELING INSTITUTE,
THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE
OF A DOG
AND A BAR OF DARK CHOCOLATE,
THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE
OF A PORN STAR AND A PORN STAR,
WELL, I KNOW <i>I'M</i> READY
TO TRY WHATEVER IT TAKES,
WHICH CLEARLY IMPLIES
THAT I'M NOT,
IT'S NOT
A COMPETITION, BETH,
OH IS THAT HOW YOU'RE
GONNA TRY TO WIN,
BY IMPLYING <i>I'M</i>
COMPETITIVE?
IF THE SHOE FITS,
MY SHOE FITS UP YOUR ASS,
YOU WISH!
OKAY, HAVE FUN,
SEE YA THURSDAY!
OH!
JERK,
DON'T INSULT MY FATHER,
HE'S THE REASON OUR KIDS
ARE ONLY HALF-STUPID,
HA! YOU JUST CALLED
YOURSELF --
OH,
BETH AND JERRY SMITH?
YES,
I'M GLAXO SLIMSLOM,
WELCOME TO NUPTIA FOUR,
YOUR MARRIAGE
CAN REST EASY NOW,
JERRY, GO AHEAD AND SIT
THERE AND PUT THIS ON,
THIS MACHINE ISOLATES
THE PART OF THE SUBJECT'S BRAIN
CONTAINING ALL PERCEPTIONS
OF ITS ROMANTIC PARTNER,
AND WE WILL NOW RENDER
JERRY'S PERCEPTION OF BETH
WITH ARTIFICIAL
BIOLOGICAL LIFE,
[GROWL]
INTERESTING,
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!
TAKE THAT BACK!
YOU DO <i>NOT</i> THINK THAT
ABOUT ME!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
THEY SCANNED IT OUT
OF MY BRAIN,
CAN I TAKE IT BACK?
THERE'S NOTHING TO REGRET,
WE'RE DEALING WITH
UNCONSCIOUS,
UNHEALTHY THOUGHTS,
BETH,
NOW, WE SCAN FOR BETH'S
PERCEPTIONS OF JERRY,
SCAN HARD,
HE'S DEAD TO ME,
EVERYTHING'S DEAD
TO YOU,
WHAT?
NOTHING,
[WHIMPER]
READ IT AND WEEP, BITCH,
[CRYING] DOES EVERYBODY
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
I THINK WE ALL SEE
WHAT YOU BOTH MEAN,
[BELL RINGS]
ANY LEADS
ON THE VAMPIRE?
NO, SUMMER!
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
THAT WE JUST L-LET IT GO,
OH, SO, NOW, <i>YOU'RE</i>
TOO COOL FOR THIS,
JUST BECAUSE
GRANDPA RICK IS?
IT'S NOT THAT, IT'S JUST
THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS A LITTLE TOO BIG TO CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING SO SMALL,
AAH!
WHAT UP, MY HELSINGS?
WHO WANTS TO HUNT
A VAMPIRE? HA HA HA!
RICK?
HOW -- HOW DID YOU --
YEAH, I GOT BORED
AND THEN, I REMEMBERED,
THIS MORNING, HOW I BLEW
SUMMER OFF, AND I THOUGHT,
"HEY, WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A GRUMPY DOUCHE, RICK?
GO TO THE GARAGE,
TRANSFER YOUR MIND
INTO A YOUNGER CLONE OF
YOURSELF, AND GET EMBROILED
IN SOME YOUTHFUL HIJINKS,
WHAT'S THE BFD?"
SO HERE I AM,
I'M TINY RICK!
O-O-OKAY,
WELL, IT'S GOOD
YOU'RE HERE, RICK,
I WAS PRETTY SURE WE
DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO DEAL WITH
A BLOODSUCKER ON OUR OWN,
DON'T SHORT-SELL
YOURSELF, SUMMER,
YOU GOT EVERYTHING IT TAKES,
BUT IT'LL STILL BE FUN
TO DO THIS AS A [BLEEP] TEAM,
MOTHER[BLEEP] TINY RICK!
YEAH! OH, MY GOD,
TOBY MATTHEWS!
HEY, TOBY, I'M TINY RICK,
I'M NEW,
HEY OH -- GO EASY ON ME,
HA HA, JUST KIDDIN',
I LIKE YOUR
STRAIGHTFORWARD STYLE
AND THAT LAB COAT'S
PRETTY COOL,
SUMMER,
HE KNOWS MY NAME!
WHY WOULDN'T HE?
YOU'RE GREAT!
BUT, LISTEN,
JUST BE CAREFUL,
WE CAN'T RULE ANYBODY OUT
AS THE VAMPIRE,
NOT EVEN THE DREAMBOATS,
STOP, TINY RICK,
HUNTIN' A VAMPIRE
WITH MY GRANDKIDS!
[BLEEP]! TINY RI-I-CK!
Glaxo: THE NEXT STEP IS
TO WATCH YOUR MYTHOLOGUES
INTERACT TOGETHER
AND, UH -- BIG SURPRISE --
IT'S NEVER PRETTY,
[LAUGHTER]
HERE WE HAVE GARRRH
AND ZHARBIDAR GLOOMPFSCHS,
OR, SHOULD I SAY,
HERE WE HAVE THE WAY
GARRRH AND ZHARBIDAR
PERCEIVE EACH OTHER,
[ROARING]
[CHUCKLING]
AS WE CAN ALL SEE,
THIS IS HARDLY THE REAL
GARRRH AND ZHARBIDAR,
WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP
IN THEIR HEADS
IS NOT ONLY UGLY,
IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE,
<i>[BEEP]</i>
[ROAR]
[GROWLING]
YOU MAY ALREADY BE
LEARNING SOMETHING IMPORTANT --
ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE DIFFERENT,
NONE OF THEM ARE REAL,
AND NONE OF THEM WORK,
WE ARE NOT THE MONSTERS
WE SOMETIMES SEE EACH OTHER AS,
BECAUSE WE ARE REAL
AND WE ARE FUNCTIONAL,
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US
BETTER THAN THEM,
WE CAN FIND SOLUTIONS,
WE CAN ADAPT,
WE CAN COMMUNICATE,
[GROWL]
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER,
WELL, IT WAS A TOUGH ADVENTURE,
BUT IT PAID OFF --
OUR SCHOOL IS VAMPIRE-FREE!
MAN, WHO WOULD'VE
SUSPECTED COACH FERATU?
YOU DID GREAT, GUYS, COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YA,
YOU KNOW, WE -- W-WE
SHOULD BE PROUD OF OURSELVES,
WE KILLED A VAMPIRE
<i>AND</i> A GYM TEACHER,
HA HA HA, TALK
ABOUT TWO-FOR-ONE, RIGHT?!
SO, HOW, EXACTLY,
IS YOUR OLD BODY LIVING
IN THERE, GRANDPA RICK?
OH, YOU KNOW,
HYPERBARIC QUANTUM FLUID,
[BURP]
THAT KIND OF THING,
IT PRESERVES LIVING TISSUE,
NOT THAT THERE WAS MUCH
TO PRESERVE, LOOK AT THAT
MUMMY! HA! HA HA!
AND I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO
GET BACK INSIDE THE OLD-TIMER,
OH, MY GOD, TOBY MATTHEWS
IS ASKING IF MY PARENTS
ARE STILL OUT OF TOWN AND
IF WE CAN HAVE A PARTY!
ALL RIGHT, WAY TO GO, SUMMER!
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
OHH! HE'S ASKING
IF TINY RICK WILL BE HERE,
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, SUMMER?
TELL HIM TINY RICK
<i>WILL</i> BE HERE!
AND TELL HIM TO BRING
SOME BREWS!
FOR REAL? Y-Y-Y-YOU
WOULD STAY AS TINY RICK,
JUST SO WE
CAN HAVE A PARTY?
HELL, YEAH!
WHAT'S ONE MORE NIGHT?
AND WHO CAN HAVE FUN WITH THIS
OLD BASTARD HANGING AROUND, HUH?

OH, RIGHT,
BLAME THIS ON US,
OKAY, UH, I CAN AND I AM!
YOUR DEMONIZED MYTHOLOGIZATIONS
OF EACH OTHER ARE COOPERATING,
ISN'T THAT GOOD?
NO, NO! IT'S BAD!
YOU HAVE THE SINGLE WORST
MARRIAGE I'VE EVER WITNESSED,
IT SHOULDN'T EXIST!
YOU SHOULD NEVER, EVER, <i>EVER,</i>
HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER
AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
HOW, OR <i>WHY,</i>
YOU WOULD EVER
STAY TOGETHER,
AAAH!
WELL, THIS IS JUST
BAD COUPLES' THERAPY,
TOTALLY,
[PANTING]
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS]
WAIT FOR US!
THERE'S ONLY ROOM
FOR ONE MORE,
I'M A THERAPIST,
I'LL TALK TO THEM,
THEY'RE NOT THERAPISTS,

WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A SMALL,

WITH A TINY AMOUNT

IF YOU CAN FIND ONE, TOO,
WE SHOULD BE SAFE FOR HOURS,
MAYBE DAYS!
YOU STAY PUT, JERRY,
I'LL SEND HELP,
IF I MAKE IT,
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND
YOUR OWN LITTLE HATCH?
JERRY, I BELIEVE THAT,
IF YOU HIDE BY YOURSELF,
YOU MIGHT SURVIVE
AND I BELIEVE I,
BY MYSELF, HAVE A SHOT
OF GETTING OUT OF HERE,
BUT THE TWO OF US,
TOGETHER?
I DON'T KNOW,
LOOK, MAYBE THE SHRINK
WAS RIGHT,
GOOD LUCK,
[ROAR]
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
OH! OR DON'T,
HEY! DON'T! PLEASE!
[HISSING]
[WHINING]
OH, GOD,
OH, GOD, OH, GOD!
NOW, I KNOW I'VE SAID,
IN THE PAST,
THAT MATH IS IMPORTANT --
AND IT IS! --
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT,
ONE DAY, YOU'LL ALL LOOK BACK
ON BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL
WITH TINY RICK AND MORTY,
WHO I HEAR HAD A GREAT
PARTY LAST NIGHT,
SO, CLASS DISMISSED,
YOU'VE GOT THE DAY OFF!
ALL RIGHT! GOOD WORK,
MR, GOLDENFOLD!
YEAH, GET OUTSIDE,

PUT ON SOME SUNSCREEN,
DANIELLE!
HEY, WHAT'S UP, SUMMER?
OOH, NICE TOP,
THANKS, TINY RICK,
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING BACK INTO
YOUR OLD BODY TONIGHT?
NO CAN DO, TONIGHT'S
THE BIG DANCE
AND MORTY'S BRINGING JESSICA,
HE NEEDS HIS TINY WING MAN,
Both: TINY RICK!
[LAUGHS]
OKAY, BUT IF NOT
TONIGHT, WHEN?
I DON'T KNOW,
WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT?
DAMN, GIRL!
YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT!
THIS WHOLE THING WAS YOUR
IDEA, IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND, NOW, YOU'RE TRYING
TO RUSH IT ALONG,
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE HIGH SCHOOL,
I LIKE HANGING OUT,
TINY RICK!
BUT WHAT IF THE YOU
THAT LIKES IT ISN'T YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
OH!
Both: OH, SUMMER!
IT'S JUST RICK
IN A YOUNGER BODY,
WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S --
WHAT'S -- WHAT'S --
WHAT'S THE --
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
LOOK AT HIS ART, MORTY,
I'VE GOT AN EMO STREAK,
IT'S PART OF WHAT
MAKES ME SO RAD,
WHY DOES IT SAY "HELP ME
MORTY AND SUMMER!"?
COME ON, SUMMER, THAT'S
THE TITLE OF THE ART,
WHY WAS <i>KNIGHT RIDER</i>
CALLED <i>KNIGHT RIDER?</i>
THE CAR'S NAME WAS KITT,
NOBODY RODE MICHAEL KNIGHT,
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING IT, SUMMER,
I'M TINY RICK!
GRANDPA, I THINK THAT,
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND
INTO THIS BODY'S
YOUNG BRAIN,
IT DID WHAT
YOUNG BRAINS DO --
IT SHOVED THE BAD
THOUGHTS INTO THE BACK
AND PUT A WALL
AROUND THEM,
BUT THOSE BAD THOUGHTS
ARE THE REAL RICK,
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE OLD,
THE FACT THAT
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE,
ONE DAY, THE FACT THAT
THE UNIVERSE IS SO BIG,
NOTHING IN IT MATTERS,
THOSE FACTS
ARE WHO YOU ARE,
SO YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THERE
AND YOU CAN ONLY
COME OUT IN THE FORM OF
TINY RICK'S TEEN ANGST!
WELL, <i>SUMMER,</i> I HEAR
TOBY MATTHEWS ISN'T
INTO PSYCHO CHICKS,
CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE
THAT IS,
I'LL SEE YOU MOTHER[BLEEP]

MORTY, YOU HAVE TO
HELP ME!
SUMMER, HE'S HAPPY!
I'M HAPPY!
I-I-IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS,
YOU DON'T WANT ME
AND RICK TO BE HAPPY?
NO,
WELL, THEN GET
YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!
GET IT ALL TOGETHER
AND PUT IT IN A BACKPACK,

SO IT'S TOGETHER,
AND IF YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT SOMEWHERE,
TAKE IT SOMEWHERE,

THE VALUE OF HIS SUBSERVIENCE
IS WASTED ON YOU,
I WILL USE IT TO DOMINATE

AH HA HA, BOY,
JERRY MUST THINK
I'M PRETTY STUPID, FOR YOU

CALL THEMSELVES
ALAN JEFFERSON
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, AM I BEING
AN ASSHOLE?
OKAY, I FEEL LIKE
EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM
IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE
I'M THE BUZZKILL,
I'M NOT?
GOOD, OKAY, GREAT,
[HISS]
OH, MY G--!
DID YOU GET ANY OF THAT?
IT'S-A GOOD-A SHOW!
[DRUMROLL]
