Summer: DAD!
Morty: DAD!

Jerry: WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE AM I?
WAS IT ALL A DREAM?

Summer: NO, YOU WERE SHOT
LIKE 50 TIMES,

Beth: 57, THANKFULLY,
YOU'RE IN A SUPER-SOPHISTICATED
ALIEN HOSPITAL,
SO IT WAS BASICALLY LIKE
GETTING A SPLINTER REMOVED,

Jerry: ALL -- ALL I WANTED
WAS FOR EVERYONE TO LIKE ME,

Beth: JERRY, REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU LEFT A COMMENT
UNDERNEATH THAT YouTube VIDEO
AND SOMEONE REPLIED
AND CALLED YOU A DUMBASS,
SO YOU REPLIED AND TOLD THEM,
"IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE,"
AND YOU STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
HITTING "REFRESH"
ON YOUR BROWSER
WAITING FOR THEM TO REPLY
AND THEN YOU FELL ASLEEP CRYING?

Jerry: I REMEMBER IT DIFFERENTLY,

Beth: THIS IS LIKE THAT,
YOU CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT
FOR HATING YOU TO BORE THEM,

Jerry: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I SHOULDN'T BE MOTIVATED
BY OTHER PEOPLE'S
OPINIONS OF ME,

Rick: ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S GO HOME,

Jerry: IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, RICK,
I'D LIKE TO GO
TO THE ZOO...
-WITH MY FAMILY,

Morty: WHAT?!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

Beth: WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?!

Morty: IT'S A STUPID IDEA!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU!?

Beth: DON'T BE A PIECE OF SHIT,
JERRY!

Jerry: OKAY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
WE'LL GO HOME,

Morty: WHAT THE HELL
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?!

Eyehole man: AAH!
- <i>I'M THE EYEHOLE MAN!</i>

Jerry: WHAT IS GOING ON? AAH!

Eyehole man: <i>GIVE ME MY EYEHOLES!</i>
<i>GIVE ME MY EYEHOLES!</i>
<i>GIVE ME MY EYEHOLES!</i>
<i>I'M EYEHOLE MAN!</i>

Rick: THAT PART OF THE CUPBOARD
IS MINE, JERRY!

Morty: WHY DO YOU
EVEN HAVE THOSE?!

Eyehole man: <i>-GIVE ME MY EYEHOLES!</i>

Jerry: HELP ME, PLEASE!
<i>GET UP ON OUT OF HERE</i>
