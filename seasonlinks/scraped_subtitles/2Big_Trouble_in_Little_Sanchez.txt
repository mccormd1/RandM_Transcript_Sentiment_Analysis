Jerry: WHAT'S NEW AT SCHOOL?

Summer: NOTHING,

Morty: NOTHING! OH, UH, ONE
OF THE LUNCH LADIES DIED,
THEY FOUND HER IN THE GYM WITH,
LIKE, TWO HOLES IN HER NECK
AND ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED
OUT OF HER,

Beth: GOOD LORD! WHO DOES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

Rick: OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE,
W-W-WHERE'S THE PEPPER?

Summer: WAIT, WHAT?!
VAMPIRES ARE REAL?!

Rick: YES, SUMMER, VAMPIRES
ARE REAL, WHO KNEW?
OH, RIGHT, ALL HUMANITY,
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, NOW,

Morty: YEAH, SUMMER,
IT'S A BIG UNIVERSE,
GET USED TO IT,
R-RIGHT, RICK?

Summer: WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?!

Rick: WE'RE GONNA LIVE OUR LIVES
UNTIL WE DIE,
POSSIBLY BY VAMPIRE,
MORE LIKELY AUTO ACCIDENT
OR HEART DISEASE,
BUT POSSIBLY VAMPIRE,

Summer: GRANDPA RICK, COULDN'T YOU,
LIKE, USE YOUR SUPERKNOWLEDGE
TO TURN YOURSELF INTO A TEENAGER
AND COME TO OUR SCHOOL
AND HELP US HUNT
THE VAMPIRE DOWN?

Morty: UM -- WOW,

Rick: YEAH, PRETTY SPECIFIC
PITCH, SUMMER,
I PROBABLY <i>COULD</i>
TURN MYSELF INTO A TEENAGER
AND HANG OUT IN THE
ZIT-COVERED, HORMONE-ADDLED,
LOW-STAKES ASSWORLD
THAT IS HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT HERE'S MY REVERSE-ASK --
WHY IN THE [BLEEP]
WOULD I EVER DO THAT, EVER?
AND HOW DARE YOU
EVEN ASK ME THAT?
AND WHY AREN'T YOU MORE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?

Summer: DAD!

Jerry: BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF,
SWEETIE,

Beth: JERRY! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
JUST SAID TO OUR DAUGHTER?

Jerry: SOR-RY! I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION,

Beth: TO A CONVERSATION
ABOUT VAMPIRES?!

Jerry: CLEARLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ABOUT VAMPIRES,
BECAUSE I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION,
WHICH <i>YOU</i> WOULD KNOW,
IF <i>YOU</i> EVER
PAID ATTENTION TO <i>ME!</i>

Beth: OH, HERE WE GO,
RIGHT TO THE VICTIM ROLE,

Jerry: AM I A VICTIM, BETH,
OR AM I MARRIED
TO A MEAN, UNFAIR MONSTER
THAT ALWAYS HURTS ME?!

Rick: JESUS CHRIST!
WILL YOU FIX YOUR MARRIAGE
OR GET A DIVORCE ALREADY?

Jerry: WELL, WE TRIED
A COUPLES' THERAPIST,

Rick: THAT'S EARTH THERAPY,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK A HORSE
TO FIX A MERRY-GO-ROUND,
I MEAN, HE'LL TRY HIS BEST,
BUT MOSTLY,
HE'S JUST GONNA GET HORRIFIED,
I KNOW ABOUT A PLACE OFF-PLANET
WITH A 100% SUCCESS RATE,

Beth: WELL, WE WANT TO MAKE IT
WORK, IF WE CAN,
IT'S JUST --

Rick: -THEN IT'S SETTLED,
NO NEED TO PACK,
-OH!
LET'S GO, GO, GO, GO!

[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

Morty: DO YOU THINK MOM AND DAD
ARE, YOU KNOW,
GONNA GET A DIVORCE?

Summer: I THINK IT'S OKAY
TO DREAM, MORTY,
I'M GONNA GO MAKE
SOME WOODEN STAKES,

Rick: I BOOKED YOU FOR A TWO-DAY
INTENSIVE AT NUPTIA FOUR,
THE GALAXY'S MOST SUCCESSFUL
COUPLES' COUNSELING INSTITUTE,
THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE
OF A DOG
AND A BAR OF DARK CHOCOLATE,
THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE
OF A PORN STAR AND A PORN STAR,

Jerry: WELL, I KNOW <i>I'M</i> READY
TO TRY WHATEVER IT TAKES,

Beth: WHICH CLEARLY IMPLIES
THAT I'M NOT,

Jerry: IT'S NOT
A COMPETITION, BETH,

Beth: OH IS THAT HOW YOU'RE
GONNA TRY TO WIN,
BY IMPLYING <i>I'M</i>
COMPETITIVE?

Jerry: IF THE SHOE FITS,

Beth: MY SHOE FITS UP YOUR ASS,

Jerry: YOU WISH!

Jerry: YES,

Glaxo Slimslom: I'M GLAXO SLIMSLOM,
WELCOME TO NUPTIA FOUR,
YOUR MARRIAGE

JERRY, GO AHEAD AND SIT
THERE AND PUT THIS ON,
THIS MACHINE ISOLATES

AND WE WILL NOW RENDER
JERRY'S PERCEPTION OF BETH
WITH ARTIFICIAL
BIOLOGICAL LIFE,

Beth: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!
TAKE THAT BACK!
YOU DO <i>NOT</i> THINK THAT
ABOUT ME!

Jerry: I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
THEY SCANNED IT OUT
OF MY BRAIN,
CAN I TAKE IT BACK?

Glaxo Slimslom: THERE'S NOTHING TO REGRET,
WE'RE DEALING WITH
UNCONSCIOUS,
UNHEALTHY THOUGHTS,
BETH,
NOW, WE SCAN FOR BETH'S
PERCEPTIONS OF JERRY,

Beth: SCAN HARD,
HE'S DEAD TO ME,

Jerry: EVERYTHING'S DEAD
TO YOU,

Beth: WHAT?

Jerry: NOTHING,
[WHIMPER]

Beth: READ IT AND WEEP, BITCH,

Jerry: [CRYING] DOES EVERYBODY
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

Glaxo Slimslom: I THINK WE ALL SEE
WHAT YOU BOTH MEAN,

[BELL RINGS]

Summer: ANY LEADS
ON THE VAMPIRE?

Morty: NO, SUMMER!
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
THAT WE JUST L-LET IT GO,

Summer: OH, SO, NOW, <i>YOU'RE</i>
TOO COOL FOR THIS,
JUST BECAUSE
GRANDPA RICK IS?

Morty: IT'S NOT THAT, IT'S JUST
THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS A LITTLE TOO BIG TO CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING SO SMALL,
AAH!

Tiny Rick: WHAT UP, MY HELSINGS?
WHO WANTS TO HUNT
A VAMPIRE? HA HA HA!
Morty: RICK?
HOW -- HOW DID YOU --

Tiny Rick: YEAH, I GOT BORED
AND THEN, I REMEMBERED,
THIS MORNING, HOW I BLEW
SUMMER OFF, AND I THOUGHT,
"HEY, WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A GRUMPY DOUCHE, RICK?
GO TO THE GARAGE,
TRANSFER YOUR MIND
INTO A YOUNGER CLONE OF
YOURSELF, AND GET EMBROILED
IN SOME YOUTHFUL HIJINKS,
WHAT'S THE BFD?"
SO HERE I AM,
I'M TINY RICK!

Morty: O-O-OKAY,

Summer: WELL, IT'S GOOD
YOU'RE HERE, RICK,
I WAS PRETTY SURE WE
DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO DEAL WITH
A BLOODSUCKER ON OUR OWN,

Tiny Rick: DON'T SHORT-SELL
YOURSELF, SUMMER,
YOU GOT EVERYTHING IT TAKES,
BUT IT'LL STILL BE FUN
TO DO THIS AS A [BLEEP] TEAM,
MOTHER[BLEEP] TINY RICK!

Summer: YEAH! OH, MY GOD,

Tiny Rick: HEY, TOBY, I'M TINY RICK,
I'M NEW,
HEY OH -- GO EASY ON ME,

Toby: I LIKE YOUR

AND THAT LAB COAT'S
PRETTY COOL,
SUMMER,

Summer: HE KNOWS MY NAME!

Tiny Rick: WHY WOULDN'T HE?
YOU'RE GREAT!
BUT, LISTEN,
JUST BE CAREFUL,
WE CAN'T RULE ANYBODY OUT
AS THE VAMPIRE,
NOT EVEN THE DREAMBOATS,

Summer: STOP, TINY RICK,

Tiny Rick: HUNTIN' A VAMPIRE
WITH MY GRANDKIDS!

BLOWIN' ME UP,
ONE LAST SWING FOR THE ROAD!
AAAAAAAAAAAH!

Summer: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
GET DRESSED!

Jerry: SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU WANNA
KEEP THIS MARRIAGE
GOING A WHILE LONGER?

Beth: AT LEAST UNTIL MORTY HAS
GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL,
OH, MM,
[MOANING LIGHTLY]

Rick: AHA, YOU SEE?
WHAT DID I TELL YOU TWO?
IT WORKED,

Jerry: YOU KNOW WHAT, RICK?
I GUESS, IN A WAY --

Rick: ALREADY LOST INTEREST,
GET IN THE CAR,
I'VE BEEN INSIDE A KID
ALL DAY AND, NOW,
I CAN FEEL MY BONES
SCRAPING EACH OTHER,
UH, JUST SO YOU'RE PREPARED,
THERE'S A BUNCH OF DEAD MES
IN THE GARAGE,

Jerry: HUH! SOUNDS LIKE OUR STORIES
WERE CONNECTED BY A THEME,
[LAUGHTER]

Rick: NOT REALLY, JERRY,
PROBABLY A COSMETIC CONNECTION
YOUR MIND <i>MISTAKES</i> FOR THEMATIC,

Jerry: OH,

Rick: OLD RICK!
RUININ' EVERYTHING!

[SQUEAKING]
[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS]

Vampire: MASTER,

Dracula: SPEAK,

Vampire: COACH FERATU'S PRESENCE
WAS DISCOVERED
BY THE HUMANS,
HE HAS BEEN DESTROYED,
NO BOTHER,
THE MORTALS SHALL SOON --

Dracula: I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU
SAY HIS NAME WAS?

Vampire: COACH FERATU,

Dracula: COACH FERATU,
THAT WAS HIS REAL NAME,
LIKE HIS ACTUAL VAMPIRE NAME?

Vampire: NO NO NO NO, HIS VAMPIRE
NAME WAS BALIK ALISTANE,

Dracula: WHY THE [BLEEP]
WOULD HE NAME HIMSELF
AFTER A FAMOUS VAMPIRE MOVIE?
WAS HE DOING A BIT?

Vampire: I DO NOT KNOW,
YOUR UNHOLINESS,

Dracula: JESUS [BLEEP] CHRIST,
FROM NOW ON, NO MORE OF
THIS CLEVER-NAME BULLSHIT,
WHEN A VAMPIRE IS PRETENDING
TO BE A HUMAN,
THEY CAN JUST
CALL THEMSELVES
ALAN JEFFERSON
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, AM I BEING
AN ASSHOLE?
OKAY, I FEEL LIKE
EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM
IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE
I'M THE BUZZKILL,
I'M NOT?
GOOD, OKAY, GREAT,
[HISS]
