Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have the <i>Titanic experience</i> in this car, and I have to mop it up,

Is it a Slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips?"

Well, at least you got all this free stuff,
Should be enough to satisfy your
