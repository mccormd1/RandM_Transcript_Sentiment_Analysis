<b>Beth:</b> Morty!"

48,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Summer:</b> Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?"
49,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Pickle Rick:</b> Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."

51,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Morty:</b> Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? "

94,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Summer:</b> How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?"
95,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Morty:</b> Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?"
96,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by <i>your</i> principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class."
97,3,Pickle_Rick,"

105,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?"
106,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very -- "
107,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Morty:</b> He turned himself into a pickle."
108,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here."

110,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> What? No, what kind of question is that?"

<b>Dr. Wong:</b> The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way."
112,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."
113,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Beth turns towards Summer and Morty]"
114,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?"
115,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Beth rolls her eyes. Transition to Pickle Rick, who has attached the bug's limbs to his pickle body and has managed to use them to move. He is looking through a grate, and is rubbing the end of one of the bug arms against one of the bars]"
116,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Pickle Rick:</b> Wow. Ugh."
117,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[A rat appears behind the grate and starts scratching at Pickle Rick, screeching]"
118,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them."
119,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[The rat breaks open one of the bars and continues to scratch. Pickle Rick starts to walk backwards.]"
120,3,Pickle_Rick,"
You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right."
121,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick scratches at a rope which is attached to a bug's arms which is holding a razor that it lets go of which is propelled upwards which breaks a rubber band which is tied to a sharp broken bottle which falls on the rat's head and chops it off, killing the rat]"
122,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick picks up the rat's head]"
123,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on!"
124,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Fresh, fresh, fresh!"
125,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[A mischief of rats appears behind the bars, also scratching at Pickle Rick, who is not in their range.]"
126,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat."
127,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick puts the rat's head onto a bottle cap which starts a machine which lifts him up and takes off his bug limbs. The machine then splits open the rat head and rips out its brain, then puts Pickle Rick down and begins nailing the rat's body parts to Pickle Rick's pickle body. It then sticks a needle into the brain which connects it to the limbs. Pickle Rick runs towards the rats and begins killing them.]"
128,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Oh, yeah! Aaaah!"
129,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[He takes out a machines on his wrists which are loaded with screws. He kills some of the rats. The screws disappear and x-acto blade pop out. He kills more rats. Transition to Dr. Wong's office.]"
130,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important."
131,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Summer:</b> And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here."
132,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Oh, he did not! "
133,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe."
134,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[No one raises their hand.]"
135,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum."
136,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Beth begins to raise her hand but stops herself.]"
137,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Beth, your hand did a little thing there."
138,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Do you really not see what's happening here?"
139,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Tell me."
140,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Well, Dr. <i>Wong</i> -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
141,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."
142,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[A short pause]"
143,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Fuck you."
144,3,Pickle_Rick,"

145,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Beth:</b> Fuck both of you, too."
146,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Transition to Pickle Rick, fighting a much larger grey rat and beating it up.]"
147,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Pickle Rick:</b> By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."
148,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick pins the rat to the wall with some screws.]"
149,3,Pickle_Rick,"
You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed."
150,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick slices open the rat's stomach with his x-acto blade.]"
151,3,Pickle_Rick,"
God damn it, I love myself."
152,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick walks up to a pipe above him. His wrist machines fall off and are replaced with a jet pack. He pulls a hood over his head with a rat's face on it. He turns on the jet pack and flies out of the pipe and out of a toilet.]"
153,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Pickle Riiick!"
154,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick opens the door. It is a bathroom door with a ""male"" sign on the front. He starts running around and opening various doors and looking in. Eventually he runs up to an elevator and tries to jump up to the buttons but cannot reach them. He tries to scale the wall but fails. He pushes a garbage can and a potted plant next to each other in front of the elevator buttons. He jumps off of the garbage can into the potted plant, then jumps into the lid which turns rapidly and propels him up and swings him to the elevator buttons.]"
155,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Get that parkour. Get that parkour!"
156,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Pickle Rick kicks the ""down button"", then waits on the ground for the elevator. The elevator opens, and three men in black suits with earpieces stand inside. They notice Pickle Rick and gasp.]"
157,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
158,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[The men in the elevator point their guns at Pickle Rick.]"
159,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out."
160,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[One of the men yells something in a foreign language into his earpiece and all three men start shooting at him. He runs away and they chase after him, still shooting at him.]"
161,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?"
162,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Transition to the frontal exterior of the building. It is a rather large light brown building with a stone fence and a plethora of guards surrounding it. An alarm blares. Some guards run around to the other side of the building's roof. Transition to a surveillance room where the three agents from the elevator are waiting. The <a class=""new"" href=""/wiki/Agency_Director?action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Agency Director (page does not exist)"">Agency Director</a> slams open the door.]"

166,3,Pickle_Rick,"

167,3,Pickle_Rick,"

168,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[A monitor shows Pickle Rick climbing into an air duct]"
169,3,Pickle_Rick,"
It's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. But look what it did on the mezzanine."
170,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[The monitor shows Pickle Rick jumping from a potted plant to the trash can to the recycling bin]"
171,3,Pickle_Rick,"

[On the monitor, Pickle Rick picks up a glass bottle from the trash can, taunts the camera with it, throws it in the recycling bin, then runs off.]"
173,3,Pickle_Rick,"

182,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Agency Director:</b> Your mere presence in this building violates international law."
183,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Agent #1 walks up to the Agency Director with a clipboard, which reads ""LEVEL 3 / ROOM 304"" in red pen. He taps the clipboard. The Agency Director looks at it and nods.]"
184,3,Pickle_Rick,"
I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men."

191,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Pickle Rick:</b> Uh, is this not a good time or...?"
192,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[Agent #1 holds his earpiece up to his ear. He gives a thumbs up to the Agency Director. On one of the monitors, six agents run up to the door of room 304 with rifles.]"
193,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Agency Director:</b> Some of my men are calling you ""Solen'ya"": The Pickle Man, an old wives tale. He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children."
194,3,Pickle_Rick,"
[One of the agents on the monitor gives a thumbs up. The Agency Director pantomimes slicing his neck to Agent #1.]"
195,3,Pickle_Rick,"

[Transition to room 304. One of the agents slams open the door, knocking over a water jug above the door which activates a pulley which pulls a string which cuts another string which swings a needle towards the agent's head, killing him instantly. Two more agents enter and start to walk in, but fall through the floor onto some spikes, which kill them. The three remaining agents walk in and see this and begin shooting at a pickle which is not Pickle Rick, but a decoy. They continue to shoot at the pickle until it is completely gone.]"

Pickle Rick jumps out of an air duct into the hallway where the three agents are, holding a device he constructed. He holds up the device and a laser comes out, which burns a hole through all three of the men's heads, killing them instantly. Three more agents come from around the corner. Pickle Rick reloads the device and shoots another laser, this time chopping off the three other agents' ankles with it. He runs away. Transition to the surveillance room.

<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Rick, why did you lie to your daughter? So I wouldn't have to come here."
318,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Pickle Rick:</b> Why didn't you want to come here? Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist."
319,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it."

So you asked."
325,3,Pickle_Rick,"
<b>Dr. Wong:</b> Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness."
326,3,Pickle_Rick,"
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse."
327,3,Pickle_Rick,"
And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control."
328,3,Pickle_Rick,"
You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle."
329,3,Pickle_Rick,"

331,3,Pickle_Rick,"
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass."
332,3,Pickle_Rick,"
Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure."
333,3,Pickle_Rick,"
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die."

It's just work."
