We tried that technique on Summer, and she's gonna end up stripping,

Why is it such a sausage planet, and how did such backward idiots invent robots?"
80,1,Raising_Gazorpazorp,"Rick: Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines,
The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age, and now they just fight with each other over fake [ Bleep ] with sticks and rocks all day long,"
