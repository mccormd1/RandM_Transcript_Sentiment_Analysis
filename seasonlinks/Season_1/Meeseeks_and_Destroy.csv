do it! Hit the button now!
"
10,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: I can’t
do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!
"
11,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: *holding
off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones
from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another
dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the
button already!
"
12,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"(Beth’s clone leaves Rick and approaches Morty, panting

"
15,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"(Morty hesitates a second longer before darting past
Beth. He glances up at the clones, then covers his eyes as he hits a button on
the wall, creating an energy field that destroys the clones, whose faces seem
to melt. Morty watches, horrified. As soon as they’re gone, Rick jumps to his
feet and grabs the device that absorbed the spirits, apparently unbothered by
the entire event.)

up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really
valuable!
"
21,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"(Screen pans out to show that Morty is vomiting in the

okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.
"
23,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: I just
killed my family! I don’t care what they were!
"
24,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: I dunno,
Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.
"
25,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Y-You
know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was
really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!
"

"
27,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Whoa
whoa whoa, *grabs Morty’s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be
like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!
"
28,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: *pushes
Rick’s hands away* You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are
supposed to be simple! And fun!
"
29,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Oh yeah,
Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position.
But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how
simple and fun it is.
"
30,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty:
*suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?
"
31,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Okay,
fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we
bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future
adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.
"
32,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!
"
33,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Every 10th.
"
34,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.

"
43,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.
"
44,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.

"
96,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Meeseeks 2: Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

"
155,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Judge: Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.
"
156,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick (sarcastic): Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.
"
157,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: We're gonna be okay, Rick.
"
158,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-(the court doors burst open and a giant in a suit walks down the isle.)
"
159,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Giant Lawyer: Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.
"
160,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"(Murmers of confusion spread throughout the court)
"
161,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: W-what the hell is he talking about?
"
162,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Giant Lawyer: They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

"
165,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?
"
166,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.
"
167,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash. 
"
168,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.
"
169,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"(They look down the stairs and see that each step is as tall as a large building. The stairs seem to go on forever)
"
170,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: Oh, boy, Morty.
"
171,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.
"
172,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Rick: What do you say, Morty?
"
173,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Morty: I say give me a hand, sidekick.
"

"
179,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Beth: Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?
"
180,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Jerry: Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner.
"
181,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"All the Meeseeks: AWWWWWWW!
"
182,1,Meeseeks_and_Destroy,"Jerry: Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.
