So, what do you say?
Do you see me working here?
Does this conversation
seem tedious to me?"

Look at me! Calm down, Morty!"
192,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Morty: No, I can't deal with this!"
193,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick: Calm yourself, Morty,"
194,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Morty: I can't deal with this, Rick!"
195,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick: Morty, Calm down, Morty,"
196,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick: You got to calm down, Morty,"
197,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Morty:
W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!"
198,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick:
Shut up and listen to me!
It's fine, Everything is fine,
There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those,
I got lucky and turned everything back to normal,
I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time,
Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine,
We're not skipping a beat, Morty,
-Now, help me with these bodies,"
199,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Morty: This is insane,"
200,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick: Look, Morty,
I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me --
I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up,"
201,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind?"
202,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Rick: What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?
The answer is don't think about it,
It's not like we can do this every week, anyways,
We get three or four more of these, tops,
Now, pick up your dead self and come on,
Haste makes waste,
I-I-I don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome,"

When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the -- the blood, and the red, and the water..."

You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?"

But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone,
I'm finally happy,"

Cronenberg Morty -- a reality where everyone in the world got genetically Cronenberged,
We'll fit right in,
Cronenberg Morty,
It'll be like we never even left Cronenberg world,"
208,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Cronenberg Morty: Yeah, Cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss
Cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?
I mean, I-I wish we hadn't genetically ruined Cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around,"
209,1,Rick_Potion_9,"Cronenberg Rick: Don't you worry about that sort of thing,
Cronenberg Morty,
Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?
