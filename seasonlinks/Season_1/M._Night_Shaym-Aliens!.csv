"
34,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Jessica: Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?

47,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*
"
48,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're
inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.
"
49,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?
"
50,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we
got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.
"
51,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!
"
52,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.
"
53,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.

"
70,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Stu: Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. (Jerry appears on a large screen.) There's another real human in the simulator.
"
71,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Jerry: Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.
"
72,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Prince Nebulon: How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?
"
73,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Zigerion 2: Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.
"
74,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Zigerion 3: Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!
"
75,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Kevin: Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—
"
76,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Prince Nebulon: Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he?
"
77,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Stu: Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.
"
78,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Prince Nebulon: *sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.

"
80,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Jerry: *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.
"
81,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"(He turns on the radio.)
"
82,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Radio: This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.
"
83,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"(Repetitive rhythmic beeping.)
"
84,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to
side in rhythm with the music*

"
86,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"(Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.)

"
88,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely.
Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a
bun between two hot dogs.
"
89,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.
"
90,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.

92,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?
"
93,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"(A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.)
"
94,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one.
"
95,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?
"
96,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?
"
97,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.
"
98,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? 
"
99,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.

102,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"(Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.)
"
103,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.
"
104,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through
space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!
"
105,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Morty: Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?
"
106,1,M._Night_Shaym-Aliens!,"Rick: We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.

gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some
water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry. (Audience stares blankly.) With that, I give you your new slogan! (Flips paper to reveal sign saying “Hungry for Apples?” Audience continues staring.) Well, say something! Do you like it?
