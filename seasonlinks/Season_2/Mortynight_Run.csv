the passenger seat, and Jerry is in the back.)
"
4,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Learning
to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be
free to go on all kinds of errands for me.
"
5,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Cool.
"
6,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: *points out the window* See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield. (Rick’s phone rings.) Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.

"

"
9,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: What
are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s
learning to drive.
"
10,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.

14,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: This is where we’re going?
"
15,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Nope. (An asteroid-like mass materializes before them.) This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered
disabled here.

"
20,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: Thank you! I’m Jerry. *extends hand*
"
21,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry-Sitter: *as if speaking to a child* Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?

Jerrys from different dimensions.)

34,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: *looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?

"
36,2,Mortynight_Run,"Receptionist: Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.
"
37,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: *checks off “Stowaway” and “Annoying me”* Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.
"
38,2,Mortynight_Run,"(As they walk out, Rick hands Morty a ticket.)
"
39,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.

"
44,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: I wanna come with.
"
45,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s *burps* business stuff.
"
46,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.
"
47,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.
"

"
51,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.
"
52,2,Mortynight_Run,"Krombopulos Michael: Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.
"
53,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.
"
54,2,Mortynight_Run,"Krombopulos Michael: *examines weapon* Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots
antimatter? My target can’t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, *passes Morty his card* please give me a call. I’m very discrete—
"
55,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!
"
56,2,Mortynight_Run,"Krombopulos Michael: I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!
"
57,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Krombopulos Michael leaves.)
"
58,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: …You sell weapons to killers for money?
"
59,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?
"
60,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Uh, what?
"
61,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!

"
65,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty’s head* Here, check this out.

"
70,2,Mortynight_Run,"Roy’s mother: Roy, what’s wrong?
"
71,2,Mortynight_Run,"Roy: I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.

"
74,2,Mortynight_Run,"Teacher: I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. (Roy looks outside and sees kids playing with a football. He smiles.) Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.

"
81,2,Mortynight_Run,"[Trans. Carpet store]
"
82,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Roy now works at the carpet store. He gets a call from his doctor.)
"
83,2,Mortynight_Run,"[Trans. Doctor’s office]
"
84,2,Mortynight_Run,"Doctor: Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly.
"
85,2,Mortynight_Run,"[Trans. Hospital room]
"
86,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Roy is battling cancer. His wife, older, sits with him.)

"
90,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Roy survived surgery. His wife wheelchairs him into the
house, where friends and relatives applaud his entry. A streamer reads “CANCER CAN’T BEAT THE ROCKET”)

"
96,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Roy gets up and steps onto a short ladder to retrieve the rugs. He loses his balance.)

"
101,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!
"
102,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with
that whole birdwatching phase.
"
103,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: *looks
around, grips his head* W… Where’s my wife?
"
104,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*
"
105,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!
"
106,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Lookit
this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.
"
107,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Rick sits in the seat to play Roy.)
"
108,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!
"
109,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*
"
110,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!
"
111,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.
"
112,2,Mortynight_Run,"Alien: *passing by, sees Rick playing Roy* Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid! (Other alien patrons gasp and congregate around Rick.) This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!

115,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Jerry approaches the Jerrysitter from earlier.)
"
116,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.
"
117,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry-Sitter: Well of course! Right through that tube. *points to a tube in the wall*
"
118,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: *muttering to self* Unbelievable. *approaches the tube and starts climbing in*
"
119,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry-Sitter: You’re doing great!
"
120,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: *indignantly* I know how to crawl in a tube. *to himself, while crawling* Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks… (Suddenly the tube transitions into a slide.) Whoooooaaaa!
"
121,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Jerry lands in a ballpit in an area designed similarly to the Smith house. Other Jerrys are in the ballpit playing Marco Polo.)

131,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!
"
132,2,Mortynight_Run,"Daycare Beth: I love you, Jerry!
"
133,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: Aw… Beth…
"
134,2,Mortynight_Run,"Daycare Beth: Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?
"
135,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerrys: Oh! Yes! Definitely!
"
136,2,Mortynight_Run,"Daycare Beth: First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!
"
137,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Jerrys become more excited.)
"
138,2,Mortynight_Run,"Jerry: The factory tint setting is always too high! *climbs out of the ballpit and hurries after “Beth” with the other Jerrys*

"
144,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Krombopulos Michael prepares to carry out the hit. He holds up a heart shaped locket with a picture of a presumed romantic partner in it, kisses the locket, and puts it away.)
"
145,2,Mortynight_Run,"Krombopulos
Michael: Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!
"
146,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Krombopulos Michael sneaks through the building, killing several Gromflomite guards along the way before arriving in the chamber his target is kept. His target appears to be a strange, gaseous being. Krombopulos Michael draws his weapon, but before he can shoot, Morty crashes Rick’s ship through the ceiling, crushing him.)
"
147,2,Mortynight_Run,"Ship: You have
arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.
"
148,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: *dazed* All out of off-white Persians… *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM’s arm and the antimatter gun*
"
149,2,Mortynight_Run,"Gromflomite: (pointing a gun at Morty) Drop the gun!
"
150,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!
"
151,2,Mortynight_Run,"Gromflomite: I guess that makes two of us. *fires up his weapon*
"
152,2,Mortynight_Run,"(A portal forms through the guard, bisecting him down the middle, and Rick walks out of it.)
"
153,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!

"
156,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: What?
"
157,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?
"
158,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”
"
159,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!
"
160,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.
"
161,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: Morty, don’t do it. (Morty walks toward the lever.) Morty… (Morty glances at Rick before pulling the lever. Alarms start to sound as Fart escapes his cell.) Morty, you idiot!
"
162,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!
"
163,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.

"
178,2,Mortynight_Run,"(A portal appears directly above the guards and water
pours out of it, flooding the room. Another portal appears on the floor, and the water and Gromflomites are sucked into it. A third portal then appears and Rick emerges through it, walking up to the car.)

"
180,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Fart moves to the backseat as Morty takes the passenger seat.)

"
182,2,Mortynight_Run,"(Morty buckles up and Rick begins adjusting the seat settings.)

183,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: More are coming.
"
184,2,Mortynight_Run,"(More Gromflomites storm into the room. Rick continues adjusting the seat.)

"
189,2,Mortynight_Run,"Gearhead: Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.
"
190,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.
"
191,2,Mortynight_Run,"Gearhead: Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire—
"
192,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: *interrupts him* So I’ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.
"
193,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: You do understand I’m telepathic, right?
"
194,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: I’m being polite.

"
200,2,Mortynight_Run,"Rick: *walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…
"
201,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.
"
202,2,Mortynight_Run,"Morty: That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.
"
203,2,Mortynight_Run,"Fart: I could not agree more.
