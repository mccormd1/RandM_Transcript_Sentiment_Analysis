"
8,1,Get_Schwifty,"Terry: The view here is the same as yours, Jim. A giant head has entered Earth’s gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years.
"
9,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jim: (in news studio) Let’s not make this political, Terry. Do we know what this giant head wants?

"

"
25,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jerry: She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!
"

"
27,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jerry: Ok…
"
28,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Rick and Morty pull out of the garage in the ship.)
"
29,1,Get_Schwifty,"Beth: Dad, what do you know about this?
"
30,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
"
31,1,Get_Schwifty,"(they fly off)
"
32,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Mr. Goldenfold arrives on a moped.)
"
33,1,Get_Schwifty,"Mr. Goldenfold: Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I’m Morty’s math teacher. I’m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.
"
34,1,Get_Schwifty,"Beth: How is praying going to help?
"
35,1,Get_Schwifty,"Mr. Goldenfold: Ma’am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let’s be rational! I’ll see you at God’s house! (leaves)
"
36,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Pentagon war room, everyone is arguing)
"
37,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?
"
38,1,Get_Schwifty,"Simon: SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity’s got. String theory, world history, the human genome.
"
39,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Nathan slams fist on table)
"
40,1,Get_Schwifty,"Nathan: Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!
"

"
45,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.
"
46,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty. (drinks from flask)
"
47,1,Get_Schwifty,"Everyone: Hi, Morty.
"
48,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Hey.
"
49,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. (points to viewscreen showing floating head) This head won’t go away until *burp* Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.
"
50,1,Get_Schwifty,"Everyone: Seriously, that’s impossible, etc…
"
51,1,Get_Schwifty,"Simon: You mean like Vivaldi?
"
52,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.
"
53,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream. (no one responds) The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?
"
54,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
"
55,1,Get_Schwifty,"Nathan: How do you know about that?
"
56,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: For God’s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps.
"
57,1,Get_Schwifty,"Aide: Sir! Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy. They’re all dead.
"
58,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?
"
59,1,Get_Schwifty,"Aide: The Grammys, sir. There was an earthquake and all the musicians... (sniffs, holding back tears) All the famous ones, they’re gone.
"
60,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Dear God.
"
61,1,Get_Schwifty,"Aide: Hold on, sir, just a minute. Ice-T survived. He’s inbound on an F-15, ETA two hours.
"
62,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Good luck, Mr. President.
"
63,1,Get_Schwifty,"Simon: Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save.
"
64,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Rick opens a portal)
"
65,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Sanchez! Are you a musician?
"
66,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: I dabble, Mr. President.
"
67,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.
"
68,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At the church, everyone is panicking.)
"
69,1,Get_Schwifty,"Father Bob: People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith! When God deals you an 11, you don’t fold! You double down, and always hit on a soft 16. That means you, Jews.
"
70,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jew: I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that’s been dealt the weak hand. Jews rule! (no one responds) Nobody? Ok, tough church.
"
71,1,Get_Schwifty,"Principal Vagina: Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. F*** all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky.
"
72,1,Get_Schwifty,"(everyone reacts)
"
73,1,Get_Schwifty,"Principal Vagina: Ah, di di di di. (to Bob) Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this (holds up a necklace with a cross) can beat that… what have you done for me lately? (tosses necklace to Bob) So if you wanna excuse me, I’m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the f***ing weather! (walks out) Outta my way!
"
74,1,Get_Schwifty,"Pastor Bob: Ok, if sanity’s been restored to this assembly, I’d like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. Sally, the plate, please.
"
75,1,Get_Schwifty,"Mr. Goldenfold: (holds up a dollar) Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!
"
76,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Helicopters over the desert, subtitle “Nevada Desert: Restricted Air Space”. Rick and Morty are on a helicopter)
"
77,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Rick, are you really a musician?
"
78,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?
"
79,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Me!
"
80,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Yeah, not with that attitude.
"
81,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jump Master: We’re in the drop zone! I’m the jump master! My name’s Jamey! With an E-Y! Go, go, go! (Rick slides down rope)
"
82,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: B-b-but we don’t have a song!
"
83,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Outside the church, Principal Vagina is on the sidewalk on his knees)
"
84,1,Get_Schwifty,"Principal Vagina: Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.
"
85,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At Area 51 speaker system, Rick and Morty slide down rope out of helicopter)
"
86,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick and Morty: WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!!
"
87,1,Get_Schwifty,"(They land on a stage with various live performance equipment on it. The yellow Cromulon is in front of the stage staring.)
"
88,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: (picks up a microphone) All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?
"
89,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!
"
90,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!
"
91,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Oh man, ok, all right, um…
"
92,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty presses a key and a beat starts, Rick knocks over a mic stand and starts “singing”)
"
93,1,Get_Schwifty,"
"
94,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Ahhhhh yeahhhhh

"
99,1,Get_Schwifty,"
(The President and Nathan are watching the performance on a screen inside)
"
100,1,Get_Schwifty,"Nathan: Get… schwifty? What the hell is that?
"
101,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what.
"
102,1,Get_Schwifty,"
"
103,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Take off your pants and your panties
"
104,1,Get_Schwifty,"Shit on the floor
"
105,1,Get_Schwifty,"Time to get schwifty in here
"
106,1,Get_Schwifty,"I’m Mr. Bulldops

Nathan: Mr. Bulldops?

"
137,1,Get_Schwifty,"(at the stage, Rick and Morty and Area 51 panic)
"
138,1,Get_Schwifty,"(The Earth is surrounded by an energy field and disappears. Earth reappears in another galaxy with four other planets, a disco ball-like sun, and several different-colored Cromulons looking at Earth.)
"
139,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At Area 51)
"
140,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: What the hell happened?
"
141,1,Get_Schwifty,"Aide: Mr. President, you’re gonna wanna see this.
"
142,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: I think planet Earth has just been transported.
"
143,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At the church)
"

"
149,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At Area 51)
"
150,1,Get_Schwifty,"Simon: Sir, we’ve started picking up on a garbled signal. We’re decrypting it now.

151,1,Get_Schwifty,"(screen gradually descrambles)
"
152,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Screen shows different bands of different aliens on different stages. Dance music plays in the background as the Cromulon narrates.)
"
153,1,Get_Schwifty,"Cromulon: WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.
"
154,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.

"
157,1,Get_Schwifty,"(dance music plays, Planet Music opening shows)
"
158,1,Get_Schwifty,"Cromulon: Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
"
159,1,Get_Schwifty,"Greebybobe: Hold it, hold it, stop! Music isn’t about competition or captivity! If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free, please!

"
161,1,Get_Schwifty,"(plasma ray powers up and fires at the planet, blowing it up)
"
162,1,Get_Schwifty,"Cromulon: There’s one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.
"
163,1,Get_Schwifty,"Arbolian Meterososian: Ah two, three, four…
"
164,1,Get_Schwifty,"(The Arbolian Meterososians play a very simple and underwhelming song while looking at the Cromulons for approval.)
"
165,1,Get_Schwifty,"(At Area 51. Rick, Morty and Ice-T are in a studio with several instruments. Rick is playing a bass, Morty is poking at a keyboard, and Ice-T is in the corner. The aide comes in.)
"
166,1,Get_Schwifty,"Aide: Rick, Morty, Ice-T. The timetable’s moved up. Earth’s on in six hours.
"
167,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Like we’re not already under enough pressure! (Morty flips a bowl of peanuts at the aide and it hits him in the head. The aide leaves.)
"
168,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick and Ice-T: Whoa ho ho ho ho!
"
169,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.
"
170,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!
"
171,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Genius happens in the moment, Morty. (walks over to keyboard)
"
172,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?
"
173,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. (presses a button on the keyboard) Balls.
"
174,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty walks toward the portal gun)
"
175,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?
"
176,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: What?!
"
177,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Yeah, *burp* you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, *burp* Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.
"
178,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!
"
179,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Hey, Morty! Could you lick my… (Rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying “Balls”)
"
180,1,Get_Schwifty,"(The President, Nathan, and his aide are watching them through a window)
"
181,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!
"
182,1,Get_Schwifty,"Nathan: I’ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.
"
183,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: And what’s your plan, General?
"
184,1,Get_Schwifty,"Nathan: We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.
"
185,1,Get_Schwifty,"President: Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.
"
186,1,Get_Schwifty,"(in field outside church, everyone is dressed in robes wearing head hats. Principal Vagina is holding a homemade satellite on a stick with an earbud)
"
187,1,Get_Schwifty,"Principal Vagina: Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!
"
188,1,Get_Schwifty,"All: Happy Ascension!
"
189,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Jerry is holding an ice cream cone, Beth looks unimpressed.)
"
190,1,Get_Schwifty,"Beth: We should pack up and leave town now.
"
191,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jerry: I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.
"
192,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Summer arrives wearing a head hat, holding two head hats. Beth double-facepalms.)
"
193,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jerry: Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!
"
194,1,Get_Schwifty,"Summer: Here’s yours! (puts hat on Jerry) Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?
"
195,1,Get_Schwifty,"Beth: Yeah, sure. Wait, what??
"
196,1,Get_Schwifty,"Summer: I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
"
197,1,Get_Schwifty,"Beth: Dinner sounds nice.
"
198,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Ethan arrives.)
"
199,1,Get_Schwifty,"Ethan: Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the Ascension?
"
200,1,Get_Schwifty,"Summer: Father, can we please go to the Ascension?
"
201,1,Get_Schwifty,"Jerry: Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?
"
202,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Three people are each tied to a bunch of balloons, tethered to a stake in the ground. One is labeled “Thief”, another labeled “Goth”, and the third labeled “Movie Talker”.)
"
203,1,Get_Schwifty,"Principal Vagina: We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies! (cuts first rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts second rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts third rope) Headward, free now to rise.

"
206,1,Get_Schwifty,"Ice-T: A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he’s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He’s like, “I’m ready!”
"
207,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Rick and Ice-T laugh)
"
208,1,Get_Schwifty,"Ice-T: Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?
"
209,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Rick and Ice-T laugh)
"
210,1,Get_Schwifty,"Ice-T: Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway.
"
211,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!
"
212,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Rick grabs the portal gun, hits a couple buttons, makes a portal in the floor and drops through it. Another portal appears in the ceiling and Rick drops out of it with several snacks.)
"
213,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: What?!
"
214,1,Get_Schwifty,"Ice-T: Damn. You didn’t tell me you f*** around with portals and shit.
"
215,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: That’s it!
"
216,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty grabs the portal gun and gets up.)
"
217,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!
"
218,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
"
219,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.
"
220,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty turns to a wall and fires a portal.)

"
222,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Nooooo!
"
223,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty jumps through the portal and Rick tries to grab him, but the portal closes.)

"
226,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Morty steps through different portals to different worlds, ending up in Buttworld.)
"
227,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: Ahhh, sh**.
"
228,1,Get_Schwifty,"(Outside of the Smiths’ home, Summer, Beth and Jerry are hoeing the front yard.)
"
229,1,Get_Schwifty,"Summer: And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!

But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!
"
263,1,Get_Schwifty,"Rick: Take it from me, Ice. *burp* You can’t just *burp* float around space not caring about stuff forever.

275,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?
"
276,1,Get_Schwifty,"Birdperson: Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
"
277,1,Get_Schwifty,"Morty: All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?
"
278,1,Get_Schwifty,"Birdperson: It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.

"
284,1,Get_Schwifty,"Birdperson: And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.

"
287,1,Get_Schwifty,"Birdperson: Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers.
