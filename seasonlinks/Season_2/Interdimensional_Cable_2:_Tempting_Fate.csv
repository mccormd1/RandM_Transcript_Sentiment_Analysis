"
51,1,Interdimensional_Cable_2:_Tempting_Fate,"Old Alien: And even if he did, he wouldn't comprehend them. I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small, it's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties, where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out ""hey look at me! I'm Mr. so and so d***."" ""I've got such and such for a penis."" I never saw it fail to get a laugh.
"
52,1,Interdimensional_Cable_2:_Tempting_Fate,"Jerry: Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!

"
58,1,Interdimensional_Cable_2:_Tempting_Fate,"Morty: Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf.

"
68,1,Interdimensional_Cable_2:_Tempting_Fate,"TV Host: How DID she get there? He he (winks at the camera)
"
69,1,Interdimensional_Cable_2:_Tempting_Fate,"Beth: Is that something we should be concerned about?
