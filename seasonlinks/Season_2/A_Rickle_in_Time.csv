6,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.
"
7,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!
"
8,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?
"
9,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
"
10,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?
"
11,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: What? What kind of monster are you?
"
12,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: A competent one.
"
13,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
"
14,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"(Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.)
"
15,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.
"
16,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
"
17,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.
"
18,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: Wait a minute, what?
"
19,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: And away we go!

25,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: ...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.
"
26,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.
"
27,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: Hi, dad.
"
28,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"(Summer and Morty recoil from Beth as she approaches to hug Rick)

"
30,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: W-We just missed you a lot.
"
31,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.
"
32,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"(Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.)
"
33,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.
"
34,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.

46,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick:  Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on. (Morty and Summer laugh) Oh you agree, huh? (Summer: Funny) You like that Red Grin Grumble reference? (Summer: Yeah.) Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.

"
57,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer: Yeah huh!
"
58,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.
"
59,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty: Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.

"
81,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.

"
90,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Shut up! (Rick turns on a monitor) Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
"

"

"
94,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer 2: What are you talking about?
"
95,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.
"
96,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Mortys: But I thought there were infinite timelines.
"
97,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.
"

"
100,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Summers: Are those cats?
"
101,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us. 
"
102,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer 1 & Morty 2: Is the world gone? Where are Mom and Dad?
"
103,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: “Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.

"
105,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?

"
108,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: Holy shit! What happened? 
"
109,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.

"
111,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: This is Rum Raisin!
"
112,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"(Beth hands Jerry her ice cream, gets out of the car and goes over to the deer.)
"
113,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: It's still alive.
"
114,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--
"
115,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: It's not an armadillo, asshole!
"
116,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.
"
117,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-
"
118,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.
"
119,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: So...
"
120,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Jerry: Well don't different animals-
"
121,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: Require different levels of skill to keep alive?

126,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible."
127,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 1: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.
"
128,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 2: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?
"
129,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.
"
130,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 1: Or...
"
131,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 2: Or?
"
132,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: We “isn't”
"
133,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.
"
134,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 1 & Summer 2: How do you know you're gonna-
"
135,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!

136,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"(Rick presses a button, the timelines almost merge)

137,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Rick: Huh, what do you know, it's working
"

"
143,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Mortys and Summer 2: That hurt! That was painful...
"
144,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both *belch* all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!
"
145,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Mortys: Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!
"
146,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 1: You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!
"
147,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Morty 2: You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!
"
148,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer 1: Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!
"
149,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Summer 2: Me? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!
"
150,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.

158,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.
"
159,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Vet: That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-
"
160,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Beth: As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!

"
170,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Vet: Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal.

174,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"All Ricks: So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?

He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...

It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point you're performing it on venison. 
"
206,1,A_Rickle_in_Time,"Hunter: Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict. I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my rec room wall.
