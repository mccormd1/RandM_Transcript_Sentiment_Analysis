11,12,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."

17,18,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"(puts an arm around Morty’s shoulders) When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam."
18,19,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,Ohh...
19,20,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,And Jessica's gonna be Eve.

25,26,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty."
26,27,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—
27,28,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"You know what, Morty? You're right. (throws empty bottle into the backseat) Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. (presses a button)"

29,30,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"(unbuckles his seatbelt) That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. (jumps up on Rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel)"

36,37,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, thank god."
37,38,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
38,39,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,It was?

48,49,1,Pilot,1,1,Scene Action:, pillow. The dog sleeps on it.
49,50,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."
50,51,1,Pilot,1,1, Summer:,Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.
51,52,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,What?
52,53,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,Dad?
53,54,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"

58,59,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later."
59,60,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"(glaring at Rick) Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
60,61,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. (Jerry stares incredulously at him) Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. (wipes his mouth and gets up, stopping behind Beth and putting a hand on her shoulder) This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. (Rick gives Beth a kiss and walks away)"
61,62,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"(tears up in happiness) Oh, dad…"

73,74,1,Pilot,1,1, Class:,Awwwwww.
74,75,1,Pilot,1,1, Mr. Goldenfold:,"Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. (Morty stares at the quiz; the numbers on the quiz jumble together as Morty falls asleep) There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. (Morty falls into a dream world filled with large number-shaped blocks; Jessica steps out from behind some of the numbers)"
75,76,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,"Hi, Morty."
76,77,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Whoa! Hi, Jessica."
77,78,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,"Can I show these to you? (Jessica opens her shirt, showing Morty her breasts)"
78,79,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!
79,80,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,You know what I named these? My little Morties.
80,81,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"(rubs the back of his neck) Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird."
81,82,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,Do you know what I want you to do with them?
82,83,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,Rename them?
83,84,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,"Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
84,85,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. (Morty grabs her breasts and starts fondling her)"
85,86,1,Pilot,1,1, Jessica:,"Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?"
86,87,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. (in real life, class has ended and Morty is fondling Mr. Goldenfold)"

97,98,1,Pilot,1,1, Frank:,"(pins Morty to his locker) ""Morning""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? (takes out a pocket knife and points it at Morty's neck)"
98,99,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
99,100,1,Pilot,1,1, Frank:,"You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich. (Frank suddenly freezes and Rick steps out from behind him)"
100,101,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
101,102,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?"
102,103,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. (burps) It's important. Come on, Morty."
103,104,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again."
104,105,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
105,106,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?"
106,107,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. (takes off with Morty and then Summer comes by, seeing Frank's frozen body)"
107,108,1,Pilot,1,1, Summer (in her head):,"Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we'll be telling our children. (walks up to Frank and talks to him, oblivious to the fact that he's frozen)"
108,109,1,Pilot,1,1, Summer:,"Hi, Frank. (Frank's frozen foot breaks and he drops to the ground and shatters into a million pieces, dying)"

117,118,1,Pilot,1,1, Tom:,"(offscreen) Okay, he's back."
118,119,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason."
119,120,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. (the heart rate starts beeping again)"
120,121,1,Pilot,1,1, Tom:,(offscreen) Losing him. (Beth adjusts the organs again)
121,122,1,Pilot,1,1, Tom:,(offscreen) Stabilized.

124,125,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,Excuse me?

132,133,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?"
133,134,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
134,135,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
135,136,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be— (a gigantic alien monster suddenly appears behind them)"
136,137,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!! (they take off, running in complete and total fear as the monster chases them)"
137,138,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!"

Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
140,141,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?"
141,142,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. (a weird looking monster is seen cooing and rolling around on the ground) What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? (offscreen) Look at it just lumbering around. (onscreen) It defies all logic, that thing."
142,143,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. (they come up to a cliff and Rick stops him there)"
143,144,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? (he and Morty are looking down upon a vast forest of interdimensional trees)"
144,145,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?"
145,146,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,The mega trees?
146,147,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school."
147,148,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?"
148,149,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an (burps) under- (burps) underfoot figure. (Rick gives Morty a pair of shoes and Morty proceeds to put them on)"
149,150,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Just take these shoes, Morty. They're (burps) special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
150,151,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"(walks off the cliff and plummets to the ground, screaming and smashing into rocks) AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!"

153,154,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?"
154,155,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
155,156,1,Pilot,1,1, Davin:,"Everything cool in here, Beth?"
156,157,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"It's fine, Davin."
157,158,1,Pilot,1,1, Davin:,"Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. (Jerry closes the door on Davin)"
158,159,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
159,160,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend. (the phone starts ringing)"
160,161,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"(sighs) Well, maybe you're right."
161,162,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?"
162,163,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"(coughs) Ahem, Horse heart surgeon. (Beth answers the phone and gets a call from Morty's principal, Gene Vagina)"
163,164,1,Pilot,1,1, Principal Vagina:,"Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"

You know, you got to turn (onscreen) the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
166,167,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!"
167,168,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?"
168,169,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something."
169,170,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. (opens another portal and leaves Morty behind, lying on the ground to suffer for a few seconds)"
170,171,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh! (Rick finally returns and injects Morty's legs with medicine, healing them to perfection)"
171,172,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you."
172,173,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"

174,175,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. (offscreen) The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
175,176,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick."
176,177,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that (burps) they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. (burps) It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left."
177,178,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,What?!
178,179,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty."

180,181,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid."
181,182,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,Uh-oh.
182,183,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."

184,185,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
185,186,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that."
186,187,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty"
187,188,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,Uuuh.
188,189,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y- (burps) you've got to put these seeds inside your butt."

246,247,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's."

251,252,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,What does that mean?
252,253,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,It's personal.
253,254,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."
254,255,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
255,256,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
256,257,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
257,258,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
258,259,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?"
259,260,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,I do?
260,261,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
261,262,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."

266,267,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,What the hell?
267,268,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,(checks Morty's answer with calculator) Holy crap. He's right.

270,271,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,But—
271,272,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
272,273,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop."
273,274,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
274,275,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. (Summer butts in, crying over the death of Frank)"

276,277,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"No idea what you're talking about. (Summer leaves, crying)"
277,278,1,Pilot,1,1, Jerry:,"Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you."
278,279,1,Pilot,1,1, Beth:,You know what? Okay. (she and Jerry leave)
279,280,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
280,281,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
281,282,1,Pilot,1,1, Morty:,"Aw, man."
282,283,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."

285,286,1,Pilot,1,1, Rick:,"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures. (excitedly looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures) And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever.

7061,7062,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Beth:,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."

The machine then splits open the rat head and rips out its brain, then puts Pickle Rick down and begins nailing the rat's body parts to Pickle Rick's pickle body. It then sticks a needle into the brain which connects it to the limbs. Pickle Rick runs towards the rats and begins killing them.]"

7088,7089,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Beth:,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
7089,7090,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Dr. Wong:,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."

7096,7097,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Pickle Rick:,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."

7237,7238,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Pickle Rick:,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle When I feel like it. So you asked."
7238,7239,3,Pickle_Rick,3,24,Dr. Wong:,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. That's our time. I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number."
